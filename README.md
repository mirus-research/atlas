# ATLAS ULTRA

**ATLAS ULTRA** is a massive-scale experimental web project built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project intentionally operates at a large code and DOM scale to explore
frontend architecture, performance considerations, and system-oriented UI design
without relying on frameworks or external libraries.

## Overview

ATLAS ULTRA is not a traditional product.
It is a research-oriented web system designed to demonstrate how large,
structured frontend applications can be organized, rendered, and maintained
using only core web technologies.

## Key Characteristics

- **Large-scale HTML structure**  
  Hundreds of system modules and components rendered in a single application.

- **Extensive CSS architecture**  
  High-volume styling rules focused on layout consistency and visual structure.

- **Data-driven JavaScript logic**  
  Large datasets, structured system models, and rendering logic.

- **No frameworks**  
  The project intentionally avoids React, Vue, or other frameworks
  to emphasize fundamental web engineering principles.

## Purpose

The primary goal of ATLAS ULTRA is to act as:
- an architectural experiment,
- a stress test for large DOM-based systems,
- a demonstration of engineering discipline at scale.

## Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Status

Experimental / Research project.  
Not intended for production use.

## About

ATLAS ULTRA is developed as part of the **MiruS** project and represents
a web platform research initiative focused on scale, structure, and clarity
in frontend systems.
